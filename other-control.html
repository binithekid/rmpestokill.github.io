          <h4>Ants</h4>
          <p>
            Ants are very irritating pests and live together in large numbers. It is estimated that there are more than 20,000 of ant species. They are small, black or reddish brown in color. They are attracted to anything sugary or oily and also get attracted to heated areas like boilers, kitchens, laundries, central heating pipes, radiators, etc. 

            <br><br>
            They form nests that are difficult to locate and leave a scented trail that once broken leave them confused and it takes them some time to form a new nest and prepare a new colony of larger participants.           
            <br><br>
            Garden ants can normally be eradicated by using insecticides in the form of dust powder or sprays directly to the nest site, but the case is not same for in house infestation as it is hard to locate their nests and trails. Professionals at RM Pestokill are experienced at handling such inside the premises ants infestation and apply environment friendly solutions to eradicate the infestation to the fullest extent.

            Black Ants Control</h4>
          <p>
            The black garden ant also known as the common black ant, is a real headache for gardeners. They nest in grassy areas and eat ripe fruits, especially fruits like strawberries. 
            <br><br>
            Ants may enter your house foraging for food or seek shelter. Understanding the activities of ants will support you with the recommended pest control procedures outlined here. 

            <br><br>
            They enter through the smallest openings, foraging for water or food. They are in examine of either sweet based food or protein/grease based foods. Once they find a food source, ants will leave a pheromone trail for other ants to follow.

            Flies Control</h4>
          <p>
            Flies can be a nuisance when active around your premise, particularly if in large numbers. However, some types of fly also pose health risks to humans. House flies transmit a wide collection of diseases including salmonella, dysentery, tuberculosis, cholera and parasitic worms.
            <br><br>
            . In India, there is a high risk of disease transmission through flies. An effective fly control program activates with sanitation and exclusion management. 
            <br><br>
            After sanitation and exclusion, we transfer a wide assortment of insecticides that come in residual forms, aerosols, fogging materials, and baiting forms. The goal in sanitation is to eliminate or prevent any medium where fly larvae will develop.
